## Versions of the DLL files

The versions of the DLL files are configured in each project's resource file ([sha3.rc](https://github.com/bilal-elchami/ExerciceHashGenerique/blob/master/Sha3/sha3.rc#L73), [sha256.rc](https://github.com/bilal-elchami/ExerciceHashGenerique/blob/master/Sha256/sha256.rc#L72))

## Difference between NIST & Ethereum

SHA-3 is a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak which is used in Etherium. it differs from the algorithm specified by NIST because NIST specified how to complete the message when the length of the message is not equal to the required input size.
